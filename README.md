### Lab 03

Using the serial monitor, you can enter:
 - 'w' to drive the robot forwards,
 - 's' to drive the robot backwards,
 - 'a' to turn the robot left while driving,
 - 'd' to turn the robot right while driving,
 - 'q' to rotate the robot left while in place,
 - 'e' to rotate the robot right while in place,
 - any other button to stop the robot.

Using the Processing sketch, use the same controls, except the robot will stop when there is no input.
